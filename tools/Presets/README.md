# `CMakeUserPresets.json` examples

This folder contains example configurations for CMake to be used locally for development builds.
Simply copy one of the examples here into the root RoughPy directory as `CMakeUserPresets.json`.
Most IDEs support CMake presets, and will autodetect these files and make the configurations
contained therein available.
