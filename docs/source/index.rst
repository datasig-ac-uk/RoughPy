RoughPy is a package for working with streaming data as rough paths, and working with algebraic objects such as free tensors, shuffle tensors, and elements of the free Lie algebra.

This library is currently in an alpha stage, and as such many features are still incomplete or not fully implemented. Please bear this in mind when looking at the source code.
