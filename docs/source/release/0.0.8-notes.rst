===========================
RoughPy 0.0.8 Release Notes
===========================

- Disabled linking to BLAS/LAPACK to reduce compile times whilst under development.
- Greatly expanded the serialization support internally.
- Many classes can now be pickled/unpickled for transport across process boundaries. (Note that this is not yet a safe means of storing and transmitting stream data.)
- Overlay triplets are now forced for all builds. This should improve reproducibility.
- Restructured the algebra module to improve build times.
- Added CMake detection of headers to help builds with non-compliant compilers.
- Fixed an error in the construction of `PyLieKey` in `PyLieKeyIterator`. [#40](https://github.com/datasig-ac-uk/RoughPy/issues/40)
